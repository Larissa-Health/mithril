### Certification of Cardano transactions

:::info Update 2024/10/02

We have activated the **Cardano transactions certification** on the `release-mainnet` network.

:::info Update 2024/09/25

We have shipped stable support for the **Cardano transaction certification** with distribution [2437](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2437.1).

A threshold of at least **70%** of the stake running version `0.2.182` (within **10** days after the distribution `2437` is released) is mandatory in order to activate the certification of the Cardano transactions on the `release-mainnet` network.

The [Mithril Protocol Insights](https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/mbL23-8gibI) dashboard displays the adoption rate of the different signer versions on the `release-mainnet` network.

:::

With the release of the new distribution [2430](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2430.0), we have started to roll-out the certification of the **Cardano transactions** in the Mithril networks.
