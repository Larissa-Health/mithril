### Distribution `2506` is now available

:::warning

- This distribution embeds a fix for the **Mithril certificate chain could be manipulated by an adversarial signer** security advisory [GHSA-724h-fpm5-4qvr](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/security/advisories/GHSA-724h-fpm5-4qvr)
- All users running a **client library, client CLI or client WASM** are **strongly encouraged** to update them to the latest version.

:::

We have released the [`2506.0`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2506.0) distribution, which includes the following:

- Support certification of the protocol parameters and epoch in the certificate chain in the clients
- Stable support for **Cardano node v.10.1.4** in the signer and aggregator
- Remove support for `Thales` era in the signer and the aggregator
- Stable support for aggregator HTTP responses compression in the signer, aggregator and clients
- Build and publish both a `stable` version (for release networks) and an `unstable` version (for testing networks) of the explorer.

This new distribution has been deployed to the **Mithril aggregator** of the `release-mainnet` and `release-preprod` networks.

If you are running a **Mithril signer**:

- **pre-release-preview** network: no action is required at this time
- **release-preprod** network: upgrade your signer node binary to version `0.2.228` - no configuration updates are required
- **release-mainnet** network: upgrade your signer node binary to version `0.2.228` - no configuration updates are required.

You can easily update your Mithril signer with this one-line command (it downloads to the current directory by default; you can specify a custom folder by using the `-p` option):

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/input-output-hk/mithril/refs/heads/main/mithril-install.sh | sh -s -- -c mithril-signer -d 2506.0 -p $(pwd)
```
