### Distribution `2513` is now available

We have released the [`2513.0`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2513.0) distribution, which includes the following:

- ⚠️ **Breaking** changes in Mithril nodes:
  - Upgraded the **minimum required** `glibc` version from `2.31` to `2.35` for the pre-built Linux binaries
  - Mithril signer with versions `<=0.2.200` **must be updated** following the cleanup of `Thales` era legacy code
  - Mithril client library `with_snapshot_uploader` function has been renamed to `with_file_uploader`.
- Support for `Cardano node` `10.2.1` in the signer and the aggregator
- End support for **macOS x64 pre-built binaries** for the client CLI
- Bug fixes and performance improvements.

This new distribution has been deployed to the **Mithril aggregator** of the `release-mainnet` and `release-preprod` networks.

If you are running a **Mithril signer**:

- **pre-release-preview** network: no action is required at this time
- **release-preprod** network: upgrade your signer node binary to version `0.2.237` – no configuration updates are required
- **release-mainnet** network: upgrade your signer node binary to version `0.2.237` – no configuration updates are required.

You can easily update the Mithril signer with this one-line command. It downloads to the current directory by default, but a custom folder can be specified using the -p option:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/input-output-hk/mithril/refs/heads/main/mithril-install.sh | sh -s -- -c mithril-signer -d 2513.0 -p $(pwd)
```
