### Distribution `2513` is now available

The [`2513.0`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2513.0) distribution has been released, introducing the following changes:

- ⚠️ **Breaking** changes in Mithril nodes:
  - The **minimum required** `glibc` version for pre-built Linux binaries has been upgraded from `2.31` to `2.35`
  - Mithril signers running versions `<=0.2.200` **must be updated** due to the removal of Thales era legacy code
  - The `with_snapshot_uploader` function in the Mithril client library has been renamed to `with_file_uploader`
- Added support for Cardano node `10.2.1` in the signer and aggregator
- Ended support for **macOS x64 pre-built binaries** for the client CLI
- Bug fixes and performance improvements.

This new distribution has been deployed to the **Mithril aggregator** on the `release-mainnet` and `release-preprod` networks.

If you are running a **Mithril signer**:

- **pre-release-preview** network: no action is required at this time
- **release-preprod** network: upgrade your signer node binary to version `0.2.237` – no configuration updates are required
- **release-mainnet** network: upgrade your signer node binary to version `0.2.237`– no configuration updates are required.

You can update the Mithril signer using the one-line command below. It downloads to the current directory by default, but you can specify a custom folder using the -p option:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/input-output-hk/mithril/refs/heads/main/mithril-install.sh | sh -s -- -c mithril-signer -d 2513.0 -p $(pwd)
```
