## Announcing the decommissioning of the `testing‑sanchonet` network

As a consequence of the shutdown of the Cardano Sanchonet network, the Mithril `testing-sanchonet` network has been decommissioned, meaning that the Mithril [aggregator](https://mithril.network/explorer/?aggregator=https%3A%2F%2Faggregator.testing-sanchonet.api.mithril.network%2Faggregator) will no longer be accessible.

The list of Mithril networks is available on the [documentation website](https://mithril.network/doc/manual/getting-started/network-configurations).

For any inquiries or assistance, don't hesitate to reach out to the team on the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/5kaErDKDRq).
