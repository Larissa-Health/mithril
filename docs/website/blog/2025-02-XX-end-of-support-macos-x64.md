### End of Support for MacOS x64 Pre-built Binaries

Distribution [`2506`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/releases/tag/2506.0) is the last release providing `macos-x64` pre-built binaries.

With the transition from Intel processors to Apple Silicon (arm64 architecture) since 2020, MacOS x64 is now rarely used. As a result, the CI workflow no longer builds these binaries for `mithril-client`.

If you rely on these binaries, you'll need to build them from source.
