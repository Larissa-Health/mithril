## Ending support for macOS x64 pre-built binaries

Since 2020, macOS has transitioned from **Intel** (x64 architecture) to **Apple Silicon** (arm64 architecture) processors.

Additionally, Cardano node version `10+` now supports only Apple Silicon on macOSX.

As a result, the Mithril team will end support for **macOS x64 pre-built binaries** for the client CLI starting **March 2025**.

From this date, **CI will no longer build these binaries** for GitHub releases. If you are still using macOS x64, you will need to build the binaries from source.
