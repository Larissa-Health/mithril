### End of support for MacOS x64 pre-built binaries

Since 2020, MacOS has transitioned from **Intel** (x64 architecture) to **Apple Silicon** (arm64 architecture) processors.

Moreover, the **Cardano node** version `10+` currently only supports **Apple Silicon** for MacOSX.

Therefore, the Mithril team has decided to end the support for **MacOS x64 pre-built binaries** for the client CLI from **March 2025**.

This means that the **CI will no longer build these binaries** for the GitHub releases from this date.
In case you are still using MacOS x64, you will need to build the binaries from source.
