This section explains the Mithril protocol, which serves as the foundational cryptographic framework for the system. It outlines the processes for creating and verifying multi-signatures, enabling secure and efficient blockchain data validation. By leveraging a stake-based threshold signature scheme, the Mithril protocol ensures scalability, decentralization, and integrity within the network.
