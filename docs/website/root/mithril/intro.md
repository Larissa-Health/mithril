# Introduction

Mithril is a protocol and network specifically designed for proof-of-stake blockchains. Its primary goal is to provide lightweight and secure access to blockchain data while ensuring a high level of security and decentralization. Originally developed for Cardano during its Basho development phase, which focuses on optimization, scalability, and interoperability, Mithril has numerous potential applications. These include synchronizing data for both light and full-node wallets, as well as facilitating data exchanges with layer 2 solutions such as bridges, sidechains, rollups, and state channels.

This section provides a detailed overview of the Mithril protocol and the network, their purpose, and how Mithril addresses key challenges in blockchain scalability and security. The section includes both beginner-friendly explanations and advanced technical insights, guiding readers from foundational concepts to in-depth protocol details.
