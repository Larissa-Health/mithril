The Mithril network consists of three main components:

- **Mithril aggregator**:

This node coordinates the production of the Cardano snapshot archives, working alongside the Mithril signer and Cardano nodes to generate associated certificates using Mithril multi-signatures.

- **Mithril signer**:

This node produces individual signatures, which the Mithril aggregator combines into a multi-signature. It operates in conjunction with a Cardano node (run by an SPO) holding stake in the network.

- **Mithril client**:

This node verifies and restores a snapshot along with other types of data, facilitating lightning-fast bootstrapping of a Cardano full node.
