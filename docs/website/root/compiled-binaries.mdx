You can install a the **latest** released binary of the **{props.node}** by running this one line command (_replace **YOUR_PATH** with your installation path_):

<CodeBlock language="bash">
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/input-output-hk/mithril/refs/heads/main/mithril-install.sh
  | sh -s -- -c {props.node} -d latest -p **YOUR_PATH**
</CodeBlock>

:::tip

You can also install the **{props.node}** binary for other distributions:

- use `-d unstable` for the **unstable** version
- use `-d **DISTRIBUTION_VERSION**` for a specific distribution (e.g. `-d 2445.0`)

:::

:::info

The Linux binaries target `glibc`, and have a minimum requirement of `glibc 2.31` (compatible with `Ubuntu 20.04`
or `Debian Bullseye`).

:::

:::warning

From March 2025 onwards, released Linux binaries will have their minimum required `glibc` version raised to `2.35`
(compatible with `Ubuntu 22.04` or `Debian 12 - Bookworm`).

If you are using a system with an older version of `glibc`, you will need to compile the binaries from source.
