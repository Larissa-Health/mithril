This section explains how Mithril certification works for different types of supported data, from computing the message signed by Mithril signers to authenticity verification by Mithril clients.

Under the hood, a certification framework leverages the Mithril protocol to provide a robust foundation for 'pluggable' custom modules that support the certification of specific data types:

- **Signers** compute messages using a specific module and broadcast them
- **Aggregators** receive signatures from signers and attempt to aggregate them into a **Mithril multi-signature** ultimately sealed in a **Mithril certificate**
- **Clients** download 'artifacts' and certificates in a **trustless way** and use them to verify authenticity.

Implementing specific modules:

- Requires significant development effort
- Must be fully deployed on the signers (the majority of SPOs registered in the protocol), aggregators, and clients before end-to-end certification can occur.
