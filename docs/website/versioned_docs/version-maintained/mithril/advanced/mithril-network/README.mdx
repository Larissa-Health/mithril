import DocCardList from "@theme/DocCardList";

This section explores the Mithril network, which consists of various nodes that work together to execute the protocolâ€™s rules for signing, aggregating, and verifying blockchain data. By distributing these responsibilities across a decentralized network, Mithril ensures secure, efficient, and scalable data validation without requiring full node operations.
