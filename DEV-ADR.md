## 1. Record Architecture Decisions

### Context

We already have a few ADRs in the `docs/website/adr` directory which document project-wide architectural decisions.
But we also want to document the rationale behind smaller decisions, so they are not lost in the shuffle, avoiding
the need to rehash the same discussions in the future.

### Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as described by Michael Nygard in this article: http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions

To keep things simple, we will store these ADRs in a single file, and use a simple format to keep them readable.

### Consequences

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above.
